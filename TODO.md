# SQLite Database Connection Loss Simulation - COMPLETED

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add SQLite dependencies (sqlite3, @types/sqlite3)
- [x] Simple SQLite database setup in index.ts
- [x] Real database connection loss simulation (actually disconnects)
- [x] Database recovery mechanism (reconnects after 3-5 seconds)
- [x] Enhanced logging for database operations
- [x] API endpoints:
  - [x] GET /users - retrieve all users (fails when db disconnected)
  - [x] POST /users - create new user (fails when db disconnected)
  - [x] GET /health - includes database status
- [x] Automatic database disconnection every 10-15 seconds
- [x] Proper error handling and status codes

## Features
- **Real Database Disconnection**: Actually closes SQLite connection
- **Automatic Recovery**: Reconnects after 3-5 seconds
- **Failure Simulation**: Disconnects every 10-15 seconds randomly
- **API Endpoints**: CRUD operations that fail during disconnection
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed logs for all database operations
- **Health Check**: Shows database connection status

## Usage
1. Start server: `bun run dev`
2. Test endpoints:
   - GET http://localhost:3000/health
   - GET http://localhost:3000/users
   - POST http://localhost:3000/users (with JSON: {"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"})
3. Watch logs to see connection loss/recovery cycles
